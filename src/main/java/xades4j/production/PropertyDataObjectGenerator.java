/**
 * Interface for generators of property data objects. This is used during signature
 * generation to create the low-level data for a property. For each type of property
 * (Java class) there has to be a corresponding {@code PropertyDataObjectGenerator}.
 * <p>
 * This is one of the core items in signature generation since it may need to do
 * all the "heavy" work, such as calculating digests and obtaining time-stamp tokens.
 * <p>
 * Classes or instances of {@code PropertyDataObjectGenerator} for properties that
 * are not supported by the library have to be registered through the {@code withPropertyDataObjectGenerator}
 * method in a {@link XadesSigningProfile}. The library includes default implementations
 * for all the supported properties but these may be overriden.
 * <p>
 * The classes that implement this interface may have dependencies on other library
 * components (and also external components configured in the signing profile).
 * To that end, the constructors and/or setters should use the {@code Inject} annotation
 * from Guice.
